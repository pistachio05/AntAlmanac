A tool that provides UCI anteaters with historical course information in a visual and intuitive way to help with scheduling and course planning. With a long-term focus on course availability by quarter and registration history, The AntAlmanac enables student to make better academic course planning decisions. Through history enrollment graphs as well as past course offerings, UCI anteaters can pick courses without the anxiety! We are built with React.js because in the 21st centry things should look nice.
